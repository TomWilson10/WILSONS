WILSONS is working hard to create an open-source version of some of WILSONS services.

An example of how you could use this could be WILSONS Governemnt. We can provide you with the code to 
create your own petition site, as long as it agrees with our license agreement.

We will have more information soon.

WILSONS will not provide support for open-source projects.
